The $ound of .\ prototype
Sources:
* src/libpunter.py -- common json read/write code
* src/player.py    -- smart offline punter, tries to find the best path (./punter is its copy)
* src/passer.py    -- simple offline punter, passes all the moves, used for debugging src/player.py
* src/online.py    -- offline-to-online wrapper+VISUALIZER, allows offline punter to play online
  I wrote my `online.py` wrapper before judges released their `lamduct`.
  Also it has "-v" option that visualizes all the moves! (needs python-pygame)
  And unlike `lamduct` it actually passes "state" to the last "stop" message.
